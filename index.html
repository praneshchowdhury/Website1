                        <h2>What Is Web Development?</h2>
                    <p>In a few words, web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. By “website,” we mean a collection of web pages that are publicly accessible on the internet.
                        Modern web development also includes web applications. Web applications are software packages that run on a web server and are accessed through the internet. This is unlike a traditional application that runs on your computer, tablet, or phone.

                    <h2>What Is Front End Development?</h2>
                    <p>Front end developers create the content you see when interacting with a website. This includes visual elements such as menus, buttons and animations that can execute on a client’s machine. Front end developers use three primary languages: HTML to create a website’s structure, CSS to change how a website looks and JavaScript to create interactive elements. </p>

                        <h2>What Is Back End Development?</h2>
                    <p>Back end developers work with the server side of a website. This involves managing web servers, interacting with databases and using data analysis — all of which are functions the user doesn’t see when interacting with the site. Back end developers may also use data-focused technologies like SQL and Python to manage a website’s functionality. </p>

                            <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is a relatively simple language that allows developers to create the basic structure of a website. Even the most complex websites have HTML at their core. It’s also the second-most-used programming language by developers, according to a recent Stack Overflow survey.</p>

                            <p>If HTML represents the building blocks of a website, CSS is a way to shape and enhance those blocks. CSS is a style sheet language used to specify the way different parts of a webpage appear to users. In other words, it’s a way to add some style and additional formatting to what you’ve already built with HTML also more attractive for the end user to view and use.</p>

                            <p>JavaScript is the most complex of the three front end languages discussed in this article, building on top of both HTML and CSS. If you’re trying to compare the languages, think of it like this: While HTML creates the basic structure for a website, CSS adds style to that structure, and JavaScript takes all of that work.</p>
